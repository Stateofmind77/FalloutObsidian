Included here is the quick start guide to making a character at either first level or any level. Follow the associated checklist for steps on how to create your character.
1. Choose your Race.

2. Assign your ability scores (aka S.P.E.C.I.A.L). Each ability score starts at 5. At 1st level you gain 3 points which you can use to increase any ability score equal to the points used. You can also decrease any ability score to gain extra points equal to the amount decreased.

3. Once you have assigned your ability scores, determine your modifier to each ability (which is noted with a + or -). Your modifier is equal to 5 minus your score. Example; if you have a 7 in Luck and a 3 in Strength, your Luck modifier is +2 and your Strength modifier is -2.

4. Choose your Background and assign your skill bonuses. You gain a +2 to three different skills listed in your chosen Background.

5. Calculate your skill bonuses. Each skill has an associated ability score which modifies your bonus to any d20 roll you make with it.

6. After determining your skill bonuses, be sure to add half your Luck modifier (rounded down) to all skills.

7. You can optionally choose one or two Traits, and you can optionally modify it with Wild Wasteland (see traits on pg. 20). Note: You can skip choosing a trait now and instead choose it after you finish building your character.

8. Calculate your Stamina Points (SP). At 1st level your Stamina Points are equal to your Agility modifier + 10.

9. Calculate your Hit Points (HP). At 1st level your Hit Points are equal to your Endurance modifier + 10.

10. Calculate your Action Points (AP). At 1st level your Action Points are equal to your Agility modifier + 10.

11. Calculate your Healing Rate. Your Healing Rate is equal to your level + your Endurance ability score added together, then halved.

12. Calculate your Carry Load. Your Carry Load is equal to your Strength score x 10.

13. Calculate your passive sense. Your passive sense is equal to 12 + your Perception modifier.

14. Calculate your Party Nerve bonus. Your Party Nerve bonus is equal to every player character’s charisma modifier added together, then halved.
		-Your Party Nerve bonus is added to your Death Saves. Additionally, whenever you roll combat sequence you gain temporary SP equal to your Party Nerve bonus.
15.
Calculate your Group Sneak. Your Group Sneak is equal to each player character’s Sneak modifier divided by the number of player characters. (Simply put; Group Sneak is the mean, or average, Sneak modifier of each player character).
16.
Add any equipment you gained from your background. Alternatively, you can choose to take no equipment and gain 850 caps. You can use these caps to purchase starting equipment
17.
Calculate your armor class (AC). At 1st level your armor class is equal to 10 and is modified by either armor, perks, or abilities. Your armor class can never be lower than 10 unless another ability specifies.
18.
Calculate your Damage Threshold (DT). At 1st level your Damage Threshold is equal to 0 and is modified by either armor, perks, or abilities.
19.
Your Hunger, Dehydration, and Exhaustion levels start at 0.
20.
If you chose Human as your race; determine your Radiation Difficulty Class (DC). Your Radiation DC is equal to 12 - your Endurance ability modifier.
If you have a weapon, calculate the following:
21.
Attack bonus. When you attack with a weapon, your bonus to hit is equal to your skill bonus with the associated weapon. Example: If you roll a d20 to hit with a pistol, you add your Guns skill to the d20 roll.
			 ○Big Guns use the Guns skill.
			○Bladed Weapons use the Melee Weapons skill.
			○Blunt Weapons use the Melee Weapons skill.
			○Energy Weapons use the Energy Weapons.
			○Explosives use the Explosives skill.
			○Mechanical Weapons use the Melee Weapons skill.
			○Pistols use the Guns skill.
			○Rifles use the Guns skill.
			○Shotguns use the Guns skill.
			○Submachine Guns use the Guns skill.
			○Unarmed uses the Unarmed skill
22.
Damage bonus. When you hit a target with an attack, you deal damage equal to the weapon’s damage calculation + your ability modifier with the associated skill used to attack. Example: Spencer’s character ‘Huck’ fires his shotgun at a radroach. Spencer rolls a d20 and adds their Gun bonus to the d20 roll. She rolls a 10 and adds 3 for a total of 13. She beats the AC of the Radroach and rolls damage. The damage is 3d6 plus Huck’s agility modifier, because Guns uses the Agility ability modifier.
23.
Choose a Perk that you meet the requirements for.
24.
Lastly, if you haven’t done so already, you can optionally choose one or two Traits, and you can optionally modify it with Wild Wasteland (see traits on pg. 20).
